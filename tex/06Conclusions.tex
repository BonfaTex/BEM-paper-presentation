\label{sec:Conclusions}

In this work, after briefly introducing the history and the main advantages of the Boundary Element Method, we first analysed the scheme in all its theoretical features. Then we presented two test case solved with the $\pi$-\texttt{BEM} library, we faced parallelisation challenges and we showed how a fast hybrid implementation can be derived.
