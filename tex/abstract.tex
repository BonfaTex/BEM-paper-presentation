The past fifty years have been marked by the evolution of computers and an enormous availability of computational power. This has boosted the development of computational methods and their application in engineering. The most popular computational method is the Finite Element Method (FEM), however around 1970 the engineering community started to develop the Boundary Element Method (BEM). This work considers the BEM theoretical formulation, and both its numerical approximation and parallel implementation based on the $\pi$-\texttt{BEM} library.
